# Work In Progress: Fire Alarm System #

## Authors

## Description

This will be a physics-supported system for simulating heat distribution 
within a room with flammable objects. When ignited, the heat will eventually 
set off a sensor to alert registered users. 

The simulation calculates and displays average temperatures in a local area as heat moves
through air (and fire moves through objects) in a still room.
